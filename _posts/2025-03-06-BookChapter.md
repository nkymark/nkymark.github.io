Our book chapter on "Artificial Intelligence in Smart Manufacturing: Emerging Opportunities and Prospects" is now published in the *Artificial Intelligence for Smart Manufacturing and Industry X.0*, which is part of the [Springer Series in Advanced Manufacturing (SSAM)](https://www.springer.com/series/7113).

Abstract: This chapter presents the significant role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing smart manufacturing, emphasizing its potential to improve efficiency, quality, and sustainability. We explore how AI integrates with critical manufacturing processes and supports the transition to Industry 4.0. The discussion includes an in-depth look at essential technologies like machine learning, deep learning, big data analytics, immersive technologies, digital twins, internet of things, and their applications in areas such as predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain management. Through real-world examples, we demonstrate AIâ€™s effectiveness in enhancing manufacturing operations and discuss opportunities for further technological improvements. Additionally, the chapter identifies challenges manufacturers face, including data security, system integration, and the need for a skilled workforce, offering practical advice on overcoming these obstacles. We not only highlight the advantages of AI in manufacturing but also address the ethical and practical complexities of its broad adoption.
