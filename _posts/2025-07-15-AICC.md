Mark Ng has joined the Technical and Skills Advisory Board of the Artificial Intelligence Collaboration Centre (AICC), which is a £16.3 million initiative led by Ulster University in partnership with Queen’s University Belfast to advance awareness and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies among businesses across Northern Ireland (NI).

Supported by Invest Northern Ireland and the Department for the Economy NI, this groundbreaking 5-year project aims to enhance competitiveness, boost productivity, and promote the ethical and responsible use of AI across diverse industries. Named as a priority for prosperity in the NI Programme for Government (2024–2027), their vision is to accelerate AI adoption within SMEs, build AI skills capacity, foster collaboration, and drive innovation across key sectors including healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, engineering and finance.  This will ultimately position NI as a global leader in AI innovation and implementation.
