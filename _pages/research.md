## General Research Activities ##
We primarily conduct research on anomaly detection and classification using model-based and data-driven methods on the following:

* Robotics and mechatronics systems to perform fault diagnosis and to enhance automation and reliability, including Digital Twinning and Industry 4.0 applications.

* Biomedical signals such as ECG and EEG to identify the key biomarkers for early detection of diseases and to enhance the accuracy of diagnostics.

## Research Facilities ##
Based in the School of Engineering and led by Mark Ng (PI) and Prof. James McLaughlin (Co-I), the DfE-funded lab features state-of-the-art robotic systems for active research and teaching in the coming years, with close to £250k of new equipment including
* 2x ER-FLEX 250 (UR-5e cobot + MiR250 AMR combo)
* 4x Turtlebot4
* 3x Bambulab X1 Multi-Filament (AMS) and Multi-Material-capable 3D-Printers
* 3x OrangeApps KUKA-compatible Robotic Arms
* 4x MinSeg Robotic System
* Sonotec PR 200 Combi Pulser
* Picoscope 5443D Oscilloscope
* Ultrasonic Immersion and Contact Transducers

Other existing equipment featured in the lab, bringing it to more than £500k in value including the new equipment above are
* INTECO Dual-Rotor Aerodynamical System
* INTECO Antilock Braking System (ABS)
* Festo CP LAB Variant 3, which includes the following:
  * 6x Pallet Transfer System
  * 4x System Trainers With A4 Frames
  * 2x CP Bridge
  * 1x Robotino + SIM Environment
  * 2x Magazine Modules
  * 1x Measurement Module
  * 1x Muscle Press Module
  * 1x Tunnel Furnace Module
  * 1x Workpiece Output Module  
* NVIDIA Jetson TX2

The lab will facilitate research and teaching in the fields of robotics and mechatronics systems, control theory, digital twinning, additive and advanced manufacturing, rapid prototyping, non-destructive testing (NDT) using ultrasonic testing (UT), etc. Furthermore, these activities will be supported by other tied-in facilities available at Ulster such as the Dell Bright Cluster HPC and Digital Twin System, which consists of the following components:
  * 1 PowerEdge R6525 Head Node
  * 3 PowerEdge R6525 Compute Node
  * 1 PowerEdge R750 GPU Node
  * 1 PowerEdge R6515 SDP Node
