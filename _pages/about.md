## Brief Biography ##
I received the BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering and the Ph.D. in Fault Diagnosis and Control System from Monash University in 2006 and 2009, respectively. I am currently a Senior Lecturer in Mechatronics Engineering and Control at the School of Engineering, Ulster University, UK, and I am attached to the Nanotechnology and Integrated BioEngineering Centre (NIBEC).

My research interests include fault diagnosis, mathematical modelling, digital twin, and data analytics for anomaly detection and classification.

In 2014–2015, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Division of Vehicular Systems, Linköping University, Sweden, where I worked with Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) on advanced fault diagnosis schemes in vehicular engines using model-based and data-driven methods.

I was instrumental in developing a Digital Twin on the MATLAB/Simulink platform for realistic testing of residuals generation and fault diagnosis methods for the following:
* Realistic modelling and control of the engine
* Injection and simulation of a variety of actuator, sensor, and variable faults in the engine
* In-house designed algorithm for additional residuals selection
* In-house designed algorithm for alarm generations, residuals monitoring, as well as Fault Isolation (FI)
* Simulation and FI of system with intermittent residuals

I was also a co-investigator in [SAFEWATER](https://www.safewater-research.com), a £5 million project funded by GCRF, where I led the development and the optimisation of embedded algorithms to control low-cost water disinfection technologies used in the rural areas in South America.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I led the [Modelling and Forecast Task Force](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/coronavirus/research/innovation/modelling-the-transmission-dynamics-of-covid-19) at Ulster where we worked with the Southern Health and Social Care Trust to provide analysis to the Government Specialist Modelling Response Expert Group (SMREG) in Northern Ireland. The main purpose of the project was to validate and inform the SMREG as well as help governing bodies in Northern Ireland to better plan for intervention measures and ultimately flatten the curve. I was also a member of the COVID-19 Task Force set up by the IEEE Region 8 community. In addition, I led a team of researchers and data scientists from Ulster and Queen’s University Belfast to work with the Incident Controller for the State Health Incident Control Centre and Deputy Chief Health Officer of the Department of Health in Western Australia to model the outbreak of COVID-19 on commercial cargo vessels.

I am a Senior Member of the IEEE and I am currently the Secretary of the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS), UK and Ireland Chapter. 

I am the Moderator for the *IEEE TechRxiv*, the Associate Editor for *IEEE Access*, and the Editor for *PeerJ*.

I am also an Adjunct Senior Research Fellow with Monash University Malaysia where I served as a Lecturer from 2009, and subsequently a Senior Lecturer till 2017.

**Visiting Researcher**  
Jan, 2016–Mar, 2016  
Collaborators: Prof. Erik Frisk, Assoc. Prof. Mattias Krysander, and Dr Daniel Jung

I continued to work on the project described under my position as a Postdoctoral with the same institution. Besides further developing the FI scheme on paper and via simulations, the project also progressed to the testing of the designed FI schemes onto the actual engine in the Engine Lab via the dSPACE control system.
